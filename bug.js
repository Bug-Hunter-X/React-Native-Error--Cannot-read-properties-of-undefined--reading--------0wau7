This error occurs when you try to access a property of a component's state or props before the component has mounted. This typically happens in the component's constructor or before the first render.  React Native throws an error similar to: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')`.

Example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: this.props.data // Error: this.props is undefined here
    };
  }
  render() {
    // ...
  }
}
```
